In my free time, I like to cook, play video games, exercise, and most of all, travel. I've been to plenty of places such as Barbados, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Mexico, and cannot wait to explore more of this world.</p>
                                <br>
                          <p>Currently, I sell electronics on eBay and Amazon. An interest in computers and technology is what led me to take this class. Upon completion, I hope to have a steady career doing what I love. I am very excited to have this opportunity and though it may be every bit of a struggle, I look forward to it all.</p>
